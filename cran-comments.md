## CRAN
This is a second minor patch to the epiGWAS package. I added the deletion of a 
temporary package created by the biglasso package on Mac OS and made the 
packages in `suggests` loaded conditionally. 

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNING or NOTES.

## r-hub builder results
There were no ERRORs or WARNING or NOTES.
