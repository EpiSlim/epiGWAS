## CRAN
This is a minor patch to the epiGWAS package. I just updated few function
names to match the latest release of the SNPknock package dependency.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNING or NOTES.

1 NOTE:
  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
       Epistasis (2:27)
       al (9:48)
       epistasis (8:42)

'Epistasis' is the name of a biological phenomenon and 'al' is the Latin
abbreviation of 'alli' to cite references in bibliography.
