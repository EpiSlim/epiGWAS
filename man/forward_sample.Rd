\title{Applies the forward algorithm to a single observation}
\usage{
forward_sample(x, p_init, p_trans, p_emit)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{one-sample genotype}

\item{p_init}{marginal distributions for the first hidden state}

\item{p_trans}{3D dimensional array for the transition probabilities}

\item{p_emit}{3D dimensional array for the emission probabilities}
}
\value{
Joint probability for the state x in a log form
}
\description{
The forward algorithm is applied in order to compute the joint
probability for the observation \code{x}. For hidden Markov models,
the forward algorithm is an attractive option because of its
linear complexity in the number of hidden states. However, the
complexity becomes quadratic in terms of the dimensionality of
the latent space.
}
\details{
Our implementation of the forward algorithm
makes use of the LogSumExp transformation for increased
numerical stability.
